A Rails-app to allow R32 owners in the US to register their cars, to help them connect with one-another, keep track of changes/services/etc. on their vehicle and generally just have a place to share their car.

This is a hybrid web app I wrote in my spare time in the Spring of 07. I'm using a lot of old Rails stuff, like the login_system generator that has now become acts_as_authenticated (or maybe it's something else now).

I also haven't written any tests for this app. I suck.
